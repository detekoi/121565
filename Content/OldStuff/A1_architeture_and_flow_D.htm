        <h1>The Testing Environment</h1>
        <p>This section provides a high level view of a typical architecture and flow of visual tests based on <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> . </p>
        <h2>Visual Testing</h2>
        <p>When implementing Visual testing using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> a test program drives an Application Under Test (AUT)&#160;through a series of  <i>check points</i> by simulating user mouse and keyboard input. At each check point an image of the application window is captured. The first time a test is run the images are stored as a series of "<i>baseline</i>" images. On subsequent runs the newly captured images are compared to the baseline images and any differences are noted. The tester then uses the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductUI" /> tool to view the differences and identify bugs.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> supports testing of applications on  web applications, mobile apps and desktop applications. The figure below illustrates a typical architecture for web applications testing. </p>
