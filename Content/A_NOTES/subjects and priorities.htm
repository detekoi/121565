        <p>You can rephrase: A sequence of steps which define the expected appearance of the AUT for given progression of checkpoints while executing a specific test in a specific execution environment.</p>
        <p>Highlight that the step is not just the image but it includes annotations of areas to ignore, moving areas, as well as issues and remarks</p>
        <p>Explain how you can see the baseline of a test in the test manager (the baseline of  test result)</p>
        <p>Branches would make the definition above more complex so I would avoid them except for a comment that mentions that baselines are specific to branches with a link to more information</p>
